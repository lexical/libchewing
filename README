libchewing - The intelligent phonetic input method library
  http://chewing.csie.net/

[-] History

libchewing is derived from Chewing input method, a xcin module
focusing on intelligent phonetic processing by Lu-chuan Kung
(lckung) and Kang-pen Chen (kpchen) during 1999-2001. However,
the original authors of Chewing dropped its development, and
Chewing was highly coupled with xcin, which prevents from
comprehensive applications.


[-] Motivation

Jim Huang started to separate core algorithm and logic layer
of Chewing since 2002, and he integrated his efforts into a
Chinese terminal named JMCCE as a part of its input method
modules. Also, in 2004, he attempts to let more applications
adapt these collaborated efforts, so that new contributors
(mentioned in file AUTHORS) created brand new Chewing Project
as the infrastructure and wrote serveral new bridges among
IIIMF, SCIM, OpenVanilla, Microsoft IME, OXIM, UIM, ibus, etc.
