libchewing for Debian

Known Problem
-----------------------
User's phrase database file may be corrupted when scim does not exit 
gracefully, for example, during an X11 server crash or power outage.

You have to remove phrase database file ($HOME/.chewing/uhash.dat for
libchewing >= 0.3.0 or $HOME/.chewing/hash.dat for older versions)

Note: you will lose all your personal and favorite phrases this way!
